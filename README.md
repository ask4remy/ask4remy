- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Remy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working with some available ransoware samples for my MSc project...
- Iâ€™m currently running a project on dynamic analysis of ransomware.
- Iâ€™m looking to use some help from anyone that has worked on such a project so I can get a heads-up.
- First of all I need to get a viable reansomware sample and would need some help in getting that here.
- ðŸ“« Am available on my email, ask4remy@gmail.com.
